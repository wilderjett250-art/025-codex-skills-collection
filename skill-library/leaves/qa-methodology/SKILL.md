# QA Methodology

Senior-to-principal QA and SDET methodology: test strategy, automation, regression, risk-based prioritization, exploratory testing, quality gates, AI code quality gates for agentic Spec-Driven Development, agentic eval design, career leveling, and SDET engineering.

## Core Principles

**If it isn't tested, it's broken.** Untested code is code whose failure mode hasn't been discovered yet.

**Quality is a property of the process, not the artifact.** Testing at the end doesn't create quality. Quality is designed in through strategy, automation, and gating throughout the cycle.

**Test behavior, not implementation.** Tests coupled to behavior survive refactoring; tests coupled to implementation break on it.

**Risk drives priority.** Not everything deserves equal test investment. Score probability × impact, then allocate accordingly.

**Flaky tests are worse than no tests.** A nondeterministic failure trains teams to ignore all failures. Quarantine on detection; rerun once, never twice.

**Independent verification is non-negotiable.** The implementing agent (or developer) must not self-verify. Separate session, fresh context, no shared priors.

## Triggers

Load this skill when the task involves:

- **Test strategy** — designing what/how/priority to test for a project or feature
- **Regression testing** — building, selecting, or evolving regression suites
- **CI triage** — diagnosing CI failures, exit codes, flake-vs-real classification
- **Test automation** — framework selection, parallelism, flaky quarantine, ML selection
- **Quality gates** — gate design, blocking vs advisory, metrics, DORA
- **Mutation-guided test hardening** — diff-aware mutation scope, surviving mutants, weak assertions, and review evidence
- **Risk-based testing** — P×I scoring, risk registers, prioritization workshops
- **Exploratory testing** — SBTM charters, oracle heuristics, session debriefs
- **Agentic evals** — eval dataset design, judge bias, flaky-eval discipline, CI tiers
- **SDD gate review** — QA ownership at spec-driven gates, AC testability, independent verification
- **SDET** — test infrastructure engineering, gTAA, CI/CD integration, career scope

## When not to use

Route to the named sibling skill instead:

- [spec-driven-development](../spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) — writing specs, running the SDD pipeline, gate verdict format, revision loops
- [agent-evals-and-observability](../agent-evals-and-observability/SKILL.md) — eval framework governance, statistical comparisons, telemetry and privacy controls, grader implementation
- [verification-methodology](../verification-methodology/SKILL.md) — collecting evidence and rendering verdicts against explicit pass/fail criteria
- [release-engineering](../release-engineering/SKILL.md) — composing test evidence into release-candidate readiness, promotion, go/no-go, production rollout, and rollback decisions; QA owns test strategy and gate semantics
- [systematic-debugging](../systematic-debugging/SKILL.md) — root-cause analysis of production incidents, bug reproduction, fault localization
- [secure-software-engineering](../secure-software-engineering/SKILL.md) — security implementation, threat modeling, secure defaults, dependency evaluation
- [playwright](../playwright/SKILL.md) — operating the Playwright tool itself: authoring and running E2E specs, selector robustness, network mocking, headless scraping, and headed debugging

## Stop and Exit Conditions

- **Test strategy complete when:** strategy document names risk tiers, level allocation, automation targets, and exit criteria for each tier.
- **Risk assessment complete when:** every identified risk has a P×I score, an owner, and a mitigation or acceptance decision recorded in the register.
- **CI triage complete when:** failure is classified (flake vs real, env vs code), root cause is localized, and a fix or escalation path is identified.
- **Gate review complete when:** every acceptance criterion maps to a verification method, the verifier is independent of the implementer, and evidence is attached.
- **Bounded escalation:** stop after three non-converging diagnostic passes and report the evidence collected so far.
