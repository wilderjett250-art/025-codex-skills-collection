# Open Design — universal design-task substrate

This skill turns the [Open Design](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design)
catalogue (kept in a local clone of the OD repo) into a workflow you can
follow inside any agent session. It mirrors what OD's own daemon does — bind
a brand spec + a template, layer in craft rules, follow the workflow — without
needing OD's daemon to be running. Preview / comment / slider features that
live in OD's daemon are intentionally out of scope; use the agent's normal
dev-server + browser-inspection tooling for that.

## When to invoke

Trigger on requests like:

- "Make me a `<artifact>`" where `<artifact>` is deck / prototype / landing /
  dashboard / poster / brochure / video template / audio piece.
- "Apply `<brand>` design system" or "make this look like X".
- "Set up a design system / DESIGN.md".
- "Audit / critique my UI", "run a 5-dim review".
- Any request that mentions Open Design explicitly.

Do **not** invoke for non-design tasks (backend, infra, refactoring, bug
fixes).

## Cross-platform note

All helper scripts are Node.js (`.mjs`) and work the same on macOS, Linux,
and Windows. The git clone step requires `git` on PATH. No bash dependency.

## $SKILL_DIR — locating the helper scripts

The four list scripts live alongside this SKILL.md. When you invoke them,
use the absolute path of the directory containing this SKILL.md as
`$SKILL_DIR`. You already know this path — it is wherever the agent read
this file from (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/open-design/` on Claude Code,
`~/.codex/skills/open-design/` on Codex, etc.). Pass it explicitly to
`node` in your Bash invocations.

## $OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT — locating the OD content

```
ROOT = $OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT  (if set and non-empty)
     | ~/.open-design-skill/repo  (default)
```

The OD repo (https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design) is cloned here once
and reused across all projects. The scripts default to `~/.open-design-skill/repo`
but honor `OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT` for users with an existing checkout.

## Workflow

Three phases: **setup** → **bind or pick** → **compose and execute**.

### Phase 1 — Setup (every invocation)

Check the OD content root:

```bash
ROOT="${OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT:-$HOME/.open-design-skill/repo}"
[ -d "$ROOT" ] && echo "OK: $ROOT" || echo "MISSING: $ROOT"
```

If missing, use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm the clone:

> Clone Open Design content to `~/.open-design-skill/repo`? (a few hundred MB)

Options (single-select): "Clone now" (recommended) / "Cancel".

On "Clone now", run:

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$ROOT")"
git clone https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design "$ROOT"
```

On "Cancel", tell the user to set `OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT` to an existing
checkout and stop.

### Phase 2 — Bind or pick

Check for `.open-design.json` in the user's project (the agent's current
working directory):

```bash
test -f .open-design.json && cat .open-design.json
```

**If it exists (bound case):** parse it, jump straight to Phase 3 with
`designSystem.path` and `skill.path` as the bodies to load. **Do not**
offer the refresh prompt or run the list scripts. Mid-project iteration
should not change template content under the user.

If the user explicitly asks to switch ("switch design system to X",
"re-pick template", "change brand"), delete `.open-design.json` first,
then continue into the unbound flow.

**If it does not exist (unbound case):**

(a) **Refresh prompt.** AskUserQuestion:

> Refresh Open Design content first? (`git pull` in the local clone)

Options: "Pull latest" (recommended) / "Skip".

If "Pull latest":

```bash
git -C "$ROOT" pull --ff-only
```

(b) **Narrow intent.** AskUserQuestion (one question, four options):

> What are we building?

Options:
- Deck / slides / presentation
- Prototype / landing / dashboard / page
- Image, video, or audio artifact
- Set up or apply a design system (no artifact yet)

If none fit, the user can pick "Other" and you ask a follow-up that maps
to one of these or to a functional skill.

(c) **Scan the relevant subset.** Run the appropriate list script with
`node`, passing `$SKILL_DIR` as the absolute path to this skill's
directory:

| Intent | Command | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| Deck | `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-design-templates.mjs"` | rows where column `mode == deck` |
| Prototype / landing / dashboard | `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-design-templates.mjs"` | rows where column `mode == prototype` |
| Image / video / audio | `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-design-templates.mjs"` | rows where `mode in {image, video, audio, template}` |
| Functional skill | `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-skills.mjs"` | (all; flag stub rows where `upstream != "-"`) |
| Design system | `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-design-systems.mjs"` | filter by user-supplied keyword/mood |

All scripts emit TSV with a header line. Column count is stable; empty
fields are written as `-`.

(d) **Filter and present.** Each list is too large to dump verbatim.

For design systems (150+): first AskUserQuestion for mood/brand keywords
("specific brand? minimal? bold? editorial? warm? technical?"), then
grep-filter the TSV by that keyword across the `title`, `category`, and
`description` columns, and only present the matches.

For templates (110+) and skills (130+): filter to the intended subset
first, then show the top ~6 matches as a compact list inline (slug +
one-line description) and use AskUserQuestion with three high-likelihood
defaults plus "Other" for a free-text slug.

When presenting stub skills (rows with `upstream != "-"` from
`list-skills.mjs`), explicitly mark them as "pointer to upstream — needs
separate install" so the user can decide whether to install the upstream
bundle or skip.

(e) **Bind.** Once the user has picked one design system and one
template/skill, write `.open-design.json` to the agent's current working
directory:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "designSystem": {
    "slug": "bmw",
    "path": "design-systems/bmw"
  },
  "skill": {
    "slug": "html-ppt-pitch-deck",
    "path": "design-templates/html-ppt-pitch-deck",
    "kind": "design-template",
    "mode": "deck"
  },
  "boundAt": "2026-05-20T13:22:00Z"
}
```

Notes on this file:

- Paths are always relative to `$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT` and use forward slashes
  (portable across OSes).
- `skill.kind` is `"design-template"` for entries under `design-templates/`,
  `"skill"` for entries under `skills/`.
- `skill.mode` mirrors the `od.mode` value from the chosen entry's
  frontmatter; omit if absent.
- If the template's frontmatter has `od.design_system.requires: false`
  (it ships its own baked-in style), set `designSystem: null` and skip
  the design-system pick entirely.
- `boundAt` is ISO 8601 in UTC.

### Phase 3 — Compose and execute

Read the bound bodies **from `$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT`**, not from this skill's
directory:

1. `Read "$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT/<designSystem.path>/DESIGN.md"` — full file
   (skip this step if `designSystem` is null).
2. `Read "$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT/<skill.path>/SKILL.md"` — full file. Look at
   its frontmatter for:
   - `od.craft.requires` — a list of craft slugs the chosen entry opts
     into (may be absent).
   - `od.design_system.sections` — which DESIGN.md sections actually
     matter for this template (use to focus attention; the full DESIGN.md
     stays loaded).
3. For each slug in `od.craft.requires`:
   `Read "$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT/craft/<slug>.md"`.
4. If the template ships `assets/` or `references/` subdirectories, treat
   those as files to read on demand when the workflow body references
   them. Do not eagerly load.

Then execute the composed workflow with this authority order on conflict:

1. **DESIGN.md** — brand tokens win.
2. **craft/*.md** — universal rules cover what DESIGN.md does not
   override.
3. **SKILL.md body** — the workflow specific to the artifact type
   (clarify brief → write files → self-check).

Write artifacts into the **user's project** (cwd), not into the OD clone
or this skill's install dir. If the template specifies an output filename
(typically `index.html`), write it relative to cwd.

## Subsequent turns in the same project

Bound turns short-circuit Phase 2: read `.open-design.json`, re-read the
same DESIGN.md + SKILL.md + craft bodies, follow the same workflow. The
refresh prompt is **not** offered on bound turns — that would change
template content under the user mid-project. To refresh OD content
without re-picking, the user can manually `git -C "$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT"
pull` between sessions.

## Edge cases

- **Stub skills under `skills/`**: ~half of entries are curated stubs
  that point at upstream repos (their `od.upstream` frontmatter field is
  set, and the body says "go install upstream at X"). Surface the
  upstream URL when offered, and ask whether to install upstream
  separately or use the stub's metadata as design context only.
- **`od.design_system.requires: false`**: the template is self-contained
  and does not need a DESIGN.md (e.g. `guizang-ppt`). Skip the design
  system pick and bind with `designSystem: null`.
- **No DESIGN.md in the user's cwd**: this skill never copies DESIGN.md
  into the user's project. It reads from `$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT` and feeds
  the contents through prompts. If the user explicitly wants a tangible
  `DESIGN.md` in their repo, copy it after binding:
  `cp "$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT/<designSystem.path>/DESIGN.md" .`.
- **Out-of-process preview / comment mode**: these live in OD's daemon
  and are not in scope for this skill. For preview/debug, use the
  agent's standard tools — start a dev server, use chrome-devtools MCP
  or playwright to inspect.

## What `.open-design.json` does (recap)

Per-project record of "we chose X design system and Y template/skill".
Plain JSON, hand-editable, intended to be committed to git so design
choices persist across collaborators. It does **not** cache the bound
bodies — those are always re-read from `$OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT` on every
turn, so a `git pull` in the clone takes effect immediately on the next
turn.
