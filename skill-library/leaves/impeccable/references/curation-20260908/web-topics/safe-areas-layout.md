# Safe Areas & Layout

Source: vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines @ e3d624baaf29dc1fc645aff3e38f03e564d2d6b1, command.md.
Apply only to the requested surface; preserve native semantics.

- Full-bleed layouts need `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notches
- Avoid unwanted scrollbars: `overflow-x-hidden` on containers, fix content overflow
- Flex/grid over JS measurement for layout
