Apply only to the requested surface; preserve native semantics.

- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant or disable)
- Animate `transform`/`opacity` only (compositor-friendly)
- Never `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- Set correct `transform-origin`
- SVG: transforms on `<g>` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center`
- Animations interruptible—respond to user input mid-animation
- Autoplay motion >5 seconds alongside other content needs pause, stop, or hide controls
- Muted decorative loops must stop under `prefers-reduced-motion`
