# Content Handling

Apply only to the requested surface; preserve native semantics.

- Text containers handle long content: `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, or `break-words`
- Flex children need `min-w-0` to allow text truncation
- Handle empty states—don't render broken UI for empty strings/arrays
- User-generated content: anticipate short, average, and very long inputs
